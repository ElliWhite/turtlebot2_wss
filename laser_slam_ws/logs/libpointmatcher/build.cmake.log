CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:189 (get_property):
  Policy CMP0026 is not set: Disallow use of the LOCATION target property.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0026" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The LOCATION property should not be read from target "yaml-cpp-pm".  Use
  the target name directly with add_custom_command, or use the generator
  expression $<TARGET_FILE>, as appropriate.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
